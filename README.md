# 00. Dealing with Outliers
In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set. An outlier can cause serious problems in statistical analyses.

Remember that even if a data point is an outlier, it's still a data point! Carefully consider your data, its sources, and your goals whenever deciding to remove an outlier. Each case is different!
