# 00. Dealing with Outliers
In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set. An outlier can cause serious problems in statistical analyses.

Remember that even if a data point is an outlier, it's still a data point! Carefully consider your data, its sources, and your goals whenever deciding to remove an outlier. Each case is different!

# 01 Dealing with data Leakage 
![Data_leakage](DataLeakage.jpg)

Welcome to my repository on **Data Leakage in Machine Learning**. In this comprehensive resource, we delve into the intricate topic of data leakage, providing you with a thorough understanding of its implications and ways to mitigate it effectively.

Data leakage is a critical concern in the field of machine learning. It occurs when information from outside the training dataset influences the model's performance during training or evaluation, leading to misleadingly optimistic results. As a result, the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data is compromised.
